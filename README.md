Encoding and decoding texts/messages using ciphers.
A three level encoding is given with the **super-encoder** app.

## Setup
* Install `node` runtime on your computer
* Run `node message-mixer.js [caesar | symbol | reverse]`.
* If `caesar` is passed as an arg, there is an optional number argument to give to indicate the level of shifts to encode with.

To use **super-encoder.js**:
* Run ```node super-encoder [encode | decode]```
